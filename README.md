## Introduction

FairBS is an approach for fairness testing in machine learning models. This experiment combines FairBS with Aequitas, another fairness testing approach, to provide comprehensive fairness analysis. The experiment supports running FairBS alone, Aequitas alone, or both approaches together.

## Prerequisites

Before running the experiment, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fairbs-experiment.git
   cd fairbs-experiment
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

The experiment uses a configuration file (`config/config.yaml`) to set up datasets, sensitive attributes, and other parameters. Ensure this file is properly configured before running the experiment.

Example configuration structure:
```yaml
dataset1:
  dataset_name: "example_dataset"
  sens_name:
    - "sensitive_attribute1"
    - "sensitive_attribute2"
  # Other dataset-specific configurations
```

## Usage

To run the experiment, use the following command:

```
python main.py [arguments]
```

### Arguments

- `--approach_name`: The fairness testing approach to run. Options: 'aequitas', 'fairbs', 'both'. Default: 'both'
- `--max_allowed_time`: Maximum time allowed for the experiment (in seconds). Default: 300
- `--max_iteration`: Maximum number of experiment iterations. Default: 1

### Examples

1. Run both approaches with default settings:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Run only FairBS with a time limit of 10 minutes:
   ```
   python main.py --approach_name fairbs --max_allowed_time 600
   ```

3. Run Aequitas for 3 iterations:
   ```
   python main.py --approach_name aequitas --max_iteration 3
   ```

## Approach Details

### FairBS
FairBS is a fairness testing approach that [brief description of FairBS].

### Aequitas
Aequitas is a bias and fairness audit toolkit that [brief description of Aequitas].

### Combined Approach
When both approaches are selected, the experiment runs FairBS and Aequitas sequentially, providing a comprehensive fairness analysis.

## Output

The experiment generates output files in the `results/` directory. These files include:
- Detailed logs of each run
- Fairness metrics for each approach
- Comparative analysis (when both approaches are run)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the experiment, try the following:

1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
2. Check the configuration file for any errors.
3. Verify that the dataset files are in the correct location and format.
4. Increase the `max_allowed_time` if the experiment is timing out.

If problems persist, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
